# Graph Theory

![Builds](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/workflows/Builds/badge.svg)

#### A part of a university assignment

</br>

## Project Overview

Implementing weighted graph data structure alongside some known graph algorithms and a simple GUI with JFrame

![img.png](uml/img.png)

</br>

## How To Run

`From the terminal : `

    java -jar .\Ex2.jar G1.json

**The jar must be placed in the project's main folder !**

</br>

## How To Use The GUI

- `Add Node` click anywhere on the canvase and enter a node key or `Graph -> Add Node`
- `Remove Node :` `Graph -> Remove Node` then enter node key
- `Add Edge :` drag and drop form two different nodes or `Graph -> Add Edge`
- `Remove Edge :` `Graph -> Remove Edge`
- To excute an algorithm `Algorithms -> `
- `Save graph :` `File -> Save` saves the graph as json
- `Open :` `File -> Open File` opens json graph file
- `New Graph :` `File -> New Graph` creates an empty graph
- `Random Graph :` `File -> Random Graph` creates a random graph

</br>

## What has been done ?

- ### Graph

    - Add node
    - Delete node
    - Add edge
    - Delete edge
    - iterate through all the nodes
    - iterate through all the edges


- ### Algorithms

    - Shortest path between two nodes
    - The center node
    - Travelling salesman problem
    - Strongly connected


- ### Json

    - Load json graph
    - Save graph as json

</br>

## Algorithms Implementation

- `Dijkstra Algorithm` for the shortest path between two nodes O(|V|*|V|)
- `Strongly connected components` to check weither the graph is connected there must be only **One** strongly connected
  component O(|V|+|E|)
- `center` algorithm using the shortest path O(|V| * |V| * |V|)
- `TSP` back-tracking algorithm N*(E+V*Log(V))

</br>

# Running Times

- Graph with 1000 nodes 20 edges

    - Build graph : 7ms
    - shortest path : 3ms
    - is connected : 4ms
    - tsp (on 4 nodes list) : 97ms
    - center : (needs more than 20 edges then it will take a long time !) *
